A firewall for Windows using drivers supplied by NTKernel.  Allowing for developers/users to create and use plugins to customize their firewall.

We want to see what kind of modules people are developing, and more importantly, we want to know what the developers need to do those modules.  We trying to expand the API as much as we can as we are trying to make more and more diverse modules.  We will also take requests for modules.

We do need $99 total so we can digitally sign our own Windows drivers, but can not afford this at the moment.  If you feel inclined to help us out and make this firewall faster and more powerful, please feel free to donate!

We here at fireBwall have decided to slow down the production cycle, bringing more relevant updates that are tested more.

We are slowly moving this project to https://firebwall.com http://firebwall.proboards.com/index.cgi

The development team here at firebwall would really like to thank Softoxi for their review, award, and video demo of firebwall.
